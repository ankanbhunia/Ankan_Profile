Since all my papers are under review, I have put all the codes in my Google Drive rather than keeping them directly on GitHub. 

I prefer to use Jupyter Notebook to implement all my DL related works using Tensorflow and Python. You may look at my codes (for .ipynb files) using online google app **"Colaboratory"**.

I take complete responsibility for the codes where I am the first author in the author list.  Otherwise, the codes have been developed along with some of my co-authors.
